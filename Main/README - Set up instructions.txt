I'll work on a way to make this universal. For now though, you may need to change the images in this file to get the program to work.

The following are discriptions of where I got the pictures for the markers:

ChromeIcon: The chrome Icon on your taskbar.

Marker: the close tab button on the chrome browser. Located next to the new tab button.

ClearDataIcon: The button to clear data inside the chrome settings url.

Marker2: The close window button of the chrome tab (next to minimise and fullscreen)

Getting the pictures is as simple as taking a screen shot and making the borders as small as possible in paint.

MAKE SURE TO SAVE THE IMGS AS PNG FILES.
